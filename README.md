## How To Use

1. It's recommended that you **Close the game** HOWEVER it is not required it still works.
2. Run `CrimsonSaveEditor.exe`
3. Go to **File > Open Save File** or use the sidebar save browser
   - Right-click any save slot for quick actions (Open File Location, Copy Path)
   - Saves are typically at: `%LOCALAPPDATA%\Pearl Abyss\CD\save\<steamid>\slot100\save.save`
4. Make your edits
5. **File > Save** to write changes (a backup is created automatically)
6. Launch the game and load your save

**New to the editor?** Check the **Guides** menu for step-by-step instructions for each tab.

## Tabs

### Inventory
Browse all items in your save. Search by name, key, or category. Filter by source (Equipment, Inventory, Vendor, Bags). Use **Unknown Items** filter to find unmapped item keys from other players' saves.

Note: The save stores stacks as single entries — a stack of 90 stones is one save record that the game splits into multiple visual slots at runtime.

### Equipment
Shows all equipment with enchant, endurance, and sharpness. **Duplicate All Equipment** to create copies for swapping. Enchant items at a blacksmith in-game first for them to appear here.

### Item Swap
Select an item from Inventory, pick a target from the category-filtered database (2,262 items with real templates). **Swap (Single Item)** or **Swap All (Global)** to transform items.

**Warning:** Swapping equipment in inventory may cause items to not appear in-game. Use the **Repurchase tab** for reliable equipment swaps instead.

### Repurchase (Vendor Swap)
The **most reliable** way to get new gear:
1. Sell a junk item to any vendor in-game
2. Save, open in editor, find the sold item here
3. Use **Clone Selected to Vendor** — search by item name, pick a same-type target
4. Or use **Swap Selected Item** for a simple key swap
5. Save, load in-game, buy it back from the vendor

**Clone to Vendor usage:** Sell a helmet to a vendor. In the editor, select it and click Clone Selected to Vendor. Search "helmet" and pick the one you want. Save, reload, buy it back. The game creates a fully correct item.

**Type-for-type rule:** Glove->Glove works. Helm->Helm works. Glove->Helm does NOT work (unequippable). If you get a wrong-type item, sell it to a vendor, then Clone it to the correct type to fix it.

### Sockets (Abyss Gear)
Swap gems in equipment sockets. 189 Abyss Gears available including combat skills, stat buffs, resistances, banes, and gathering bonuses. Empty sockets must have a gem installed in-game first (Witch NPC > Create Socket > Embed Abyss Gear).

### ItemBuffs (Stat Editing)
Edit base stats on ANY item in the game data files. Extract iteminfo, search for items, apply presets:
- **Max All** — Max every stat value (flat to 999,999, rates to Lv 15)
- **Max DDD/DPV/HP** — Max specific stat types
- **Custom** — Pick any stat and set a specific value
- **Also apply Max Stacks** — Check the box to also set all stackable items to 99/999/9999 (replaces FatStacks mod, survives game updates)

Use **My Inventory** button to instantly list items from your loaded save.

Right-click items to add them to **Equipment Sets** — reusable buff presets you can share with the community.

**Requires admin privileges** to write game files. Use Restore Original or Steam Verify Integrity if issues occur.

### GPatch (Game Patches)
Apply game file patches that survive save changes:
- **Mount Death Respawn (1s)** — Sets all 32 mount/vehicle death respawn timers to 1 second (vanilla: ~90 min). Note: Dragon summon duration/cooldown is hardcoded and cannot be modified.
- **Storage Expansion (900)** — Expand warehouse, bank, and camp storage to 900 slots. Does NOT modify player inventory (which causes bugs).
- **Item Effect Swap** — Swap consumable use-effects between items by patching effect hashes in iteminfo.pabgb. Change what happens when you use an item in-game.

### Item Packs
Download community item collections from GitHub. Create your own packs to share loadouts with others.

### Community Mapping
Help map every item in Crimson Desert. Scan your saves to discover new item templates and upload them to the community database. The more saves we scan, the more items the editor can support.

## Adding Items

### PARC Insert (No Donor Needed)
The **Add New Item (PARC Insert)** button creates brand new items in your inventory:
1. Click **Add New Item (PARC Insert)** in the Inventory tab
2. Select the item (currently Narima's Horn for Dragon CD reset)
3. Set the quantity and confirm
4. Save and reload in-game (may require 2 reloads but not usually)

### Clone to Vendor (Best for Equipment)
The **Clone Selected to Vendor** button in the Repurchase tab is the best way to get equipment:
1. Sell any junk item to a vendor in-game, save
2. Open save in editor, go to Repurchase tab
3. Select the sold item, click **Clone Selected to Vendor**
4. Search for the item you want by name (must be same type as donor)
5. Save, reload, buy it back from the vendor

### Give Item (Donor System)
Transforms an existing item into the one you want:
1. Click **Give Item** in the Inventory tab
2. Search and select the item you want, set the quantity
3. Pick a donor item from your inventory to sacrifice
4. Confirm — the donor becomes the target item

**Tip:** Buy cheap materials from a vendor in-game to use as donors.

## Known Limitations

- **PARC Insert limited items** — Currently only Narima's Horn is confirmed for direct inventory insertion. More items coming as testing continues.
- **Type-for-type swaps only** — Vendor clone/swap must match equipment type (Glove->Glove, Helm->Helm). Cross-type produces unequippable items.
- **Equipment stats after swap** — Swapped equipment may show wrong damage/defense until unequip + re-equip
- **Empty sockets** — Cannot fill empty sockets from the editor, must install a gem in-game first
- **Dragon summon timer** — 15 min duration / 50 min cooldown is hardcoded in game executable, cannot be patched
- **Lobby saves** — Only `save.save` (in-game saves) are supported, not `lobby.save`
- **Longer load time** — Full tree verification adds processing time. Optimization in progress.

## Save File Locations

| Platform | Path |
|----------|------|
| Steam | `%LOCALAPPDATA%\Pearl Abyss\CD\save\<id>\slot100\save.save` |
| Epic | `%LOCALAPPDATA%\Pearl Abyss\CD_Epic\save\<id>\slot100\save.save` |
| Game Pass | `%LOCALAPPDATA%\Pearl Abyss\CD_GamePass\save\<id>\slot100\save.save` |
| Linux (Proton) | `~/.steam/steam/steamapps/compatdata/2623190/pfx/drive_c/users/steamuser/AppData/Local/Pearl Abyss/CD/save/<id>/slot100/save.save` |

Slot numbering: `slot0-2` = autosaves, `slot100-108` = manual saves (slot 1-9 in-game).

## Troubleshooting

**"HMAC mismatch" warning on load**
The save may be from a different game version or was partially corrupted. The editor will still try to load it.

**Game doesn't load the edited save**
Restore from the automatic backup (Backup/Restore tab) and try again. Make sure the game is fully closed before editing.

**No items shown after loading**
The save file might be a lobby save (`lobby.save`) which has minimal data. Use `save.save` instead.

**Corrupted backup file**
If a backup was created from an already-broken save, it will also be corrupt. Use an earlier backup or the pristine backup.

**Game says "installation failed" after patching**
The PAPGT integrity file may not have updated correctly. Click "Restore Original" in ItemBuffs tab, then try again. Or use Steam > Verify Integrity of Game Files.

## Technical Details

The editor handles the full save file crypto pipeline:
- **Decryption:** ChaCha20 (RFC 7539) — C-backed via `cryptography` library for 10x speed
- **Integrity:** HMAC-SHA256 verification
- **Compression:** LZ4 HC (high compression)
- **Format:** PARC (Pearl Abyss Reflect Container) binary serialization
- **Game Data:** iteminfo.pabgb / vehicleinfo.pabgb / inventory.pabgb editing via LZ4 repack into PAZ archives
